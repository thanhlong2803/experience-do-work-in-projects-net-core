# Let me write what me feel about NET 6 and Entity Framework and experience always bring value.

***+ You should know and understand***
1. ***What is class?***
     A class contains all of the objects that have the same characteristic, behavior, and method. 
We have characteristic of object called filed and characteristic of object displaying out through using property of class.
     A behavior and method of the object is a method.
 Example : Chúng ta có thể lấy ví dụ  Việt Nam , công an hay gọi ăn trộm là đối tượng , Vậy ta có class ăn trộm thì có nhìu đối tượng ăn trộm mà ở đó ta có thể liệt kê vài đặt điểm giống nhau , phương thức ăn trôm giống nhau.
