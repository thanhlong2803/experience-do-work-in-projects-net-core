# Introduce Asp .net core
 ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications. With ASP.NET Core, you can

# What is MVC ?
***Explain MVC (Model-View-Controller.)***

Stands for "Model-View-Controller." MVC is an  aplication  design model  comprised  [bao gồm]  x  of three  interconnected  [kết nối với nhau]  x  parts. They include the model data, the view (user interface), and the controller (processes  that handle input).

The MVC model or "pattern" is commonly used for developing modern user interfaces. It is provides the fundamental [cơ bản] x pieces [miếng] x for designing a  programs for  desktop  or  mobile, as well as web applications. It works well with object-oriented programming, since the different models, views, and controllers can be treated [điều hướng] x as objects and reused within an application.

Below is a description of each aspect of MVC:

**1. Model:** In simple words, the Model contains data about the application. All the information that is essential to be shown or displayed, its requirements with respect to access and other validations are all specified here.

**2. View:** View displays the data in the Model component. Any response from the user is also recognized and sent to the Controller component.

**3. Controller:** The Controller is responsible for providing the data present in the Model to the View component and interpreting the user responses that the View component recognizes.

### Required Skills
-   Complete understanding of the architectural pattern.
-   Understanding how to use the framework.
-   Basic knowledge of an object-oriented programming language.
-   Ability to separate logic and display contents, ensuring that the Model and View are independent of each other.

***- We should use MVC because:***

-   There is no need to type the code again. Thus it enables Reusability.
-   It helps in efficient [có hiệu quả] x testing of the application during the testing phase.
-   If there are any modifications [sửa đổi] x, then there is no need to edit the application’s entire code.
-   It helps in the better maintenance of the application.
-   It reduces ambiguity [sự mơ hồ] x and uncertainty [tính không chắc chắn] x.
-   The most important thing we can do with MVC is an abstraction of logic from View.
# Why use to Asp .Net core REST ?
It is a framework that helps us to build or deploy the services of HTTP.

It is already implemented in our project for documenting the web service in this project we have separate  [tách rời]  x endpoints for getting ***POST, DELETE AND PUT***

***What is the REST?***

REST, which is a very important architectural style nowadays is relying [dựa vào] x completely [hoàn toàn] x on utilizing [sử dụng] x HTTP features, so that makes HTTP even [thậm chí] x more important to understand. If you want to make great RESTful applications, you must understand HTTP first.

***What is the HTTP?***
This is the second part of the HTTP Series:
	Web Servers
	Proxy Servers
	Caching
	Gateways, Tunnels, and Relays
	Web Crawlers
